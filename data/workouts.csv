"Reco Day","Day Off","In the pro cycling world Monday is considered the 'international day of rest'. Your body will be working hard nearly every other day of the week with bike and 'off bike' life. 1 day/ week to allow the body to rebuild, recoup from the stress that has been placed on it increases the effectiveness of the training. Also can be refreshing for the mind and motivation to allow yourself at least 1day/week away from the bike.","","","2022-02-21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"
"CORE strength ON the bike.","Bike","This is an interesting one. Can keep both feet clipped in for the whole ride this time. But something different thrown in there, an old trick from the Australian Institute of Sport, it's simple but VERY effective. For the 2 minute working efforts this time you are allowed to touch the handlebars with your FINGERTIPS ONLY. This engages your core/ stabilising muscles, you'll feel it! Be cogniscent of your upper body, you want to try to keep relatively still in these efforts, no swaying side to side. Imagine there is a spirit level across your shoulder blades. Focus your energy to your core & legs, that's where the bike wants it! I used to find these very satisfying and an easy way to engage more of the body than just the legs which is very important for getting as much power into those pedals as possible..","1","","2022-02-22","15min: increasing intensity warm up. You should have some sweat dripping down by the end of this and have the Heart Rate pumping so you feel like you're about ready to smash some efforts. 25min: 5x 2min 7/10- 3min 2/10. ALL 7RPE efforts must be FINGERTIPS ONLY touching the handlebars. 10min: 7RPE, this is a good way to make the most of this workout, after those fingertip efforts you should be tired but find 10min of power to push through and sweat it out to the warm down. Put as much gas down as you like here.. Feel that core a little more engaged! 10min: warm down 2/10. Keep the cadence nice and high in the cool down (90+rpm)..","24718.990234375","","",""," *22/02/2022 Matthew Roberts: I was genuinely pedallig at 4 RPE but my HR was much higher than I expected based on leg feel.  I suppose engaging the extra muscles does that?  Wasn't able to hold my form for teh 10 min interval.  Kept to fingertips but was sitting up, resting on a leg, etc.* *22/02/2022 Matthew Roberts: A wet quarter sessions rd is not long enough for a 10 min effort!  I only got an hour between storms, so it was the best I could do.* *24/02/2022 Justin Morris: Glad you got out mate. Hats off to ya for braving the elements. The high HR can result from a number of things: - the novelty of an effort - humidity - freshness - coming down with a virus.. So think it likely the first 3 of those for you. Kind of good to know the legs were only at 4RPE. Means your strength is good. Just the cardio that will help from here. Anyway, first session done.

"SPIN to WIN!","Bike","This could be done outside on a flat road. A cadence counter will be a big benefit here this measures how fast your pedals spin around (in RPM). If you do not have one of these feel the sensation of spinning those legs in the easiest gear possible.. This is the sensation you want to aim for in most of this workout. A fast, consistent cadence (leg speed) is a crucial key to unlocking power, efficiency and form on the bike. Have a look at a professional cyclist in a race. Not the speed of the legs turning around it is fast, not so much grinding but spinning! When you spin as opposed to 'grind' the pedals you sustain the energy in your muscles for longer and you end up getting more power into the pedals. A high cadence also activates more of your cardio system so you are getting a very comprehensive fitness/ weight loss workout. Grinding a hard gear you activate the strength/ aerobic system which would be similar to going to the gym and doing leg press/ squats. Note the higher leg speed in the working sections, this should help spike your heart rate and ensure not only a good development of form/ style but also a full gas cardio workout! SPIN to WIN!!","1","","2022-02-23","10min: Z1- 4/10 Perceived Rate of Exhaustion. 15min: Z2- 7/10 PRE 10min: Z1- 5/10 15min: Z2- 7/10 little harder than first effort. 10min: Z1- 4/10 cool down.","27160.4296875","","",""," *23/02/2022 Matthew Roberts: Spinning is not my forte!  Right knee (which sometimes give me grief) was not happy on first interval but better on second.  I think it was my poor form, which did improve.  It genuinely takes all my brain power to keep a high cadence.  Changing gears every second because any up or down slope puts you out of the range.  beyond 105rpm and I can't keep good form.  I cannot spin fast without some pressure on the pedals either.  If I want to keep spinning easily on a down slope when the bike is speeding up, my pedal stroke goes super lumpy and it feels terrible.  Still, got it done.* *24/02/2022 Justin Morris: Yeah, thats normal when doing this outside. Your feedback there is pretty normal for outside spinning on lumpy terrain. Rest assured you will still get benefit from it. Good to teach yourself to spin the legs even on the downhills too. It may feel clunky etc but it is still serving a purpose in flushing lactic out of the legs.*","1.02555561065674","7.35699987411499","","98","","145","177","","","0.730077469045891","60.59","0","2","19","13","18","8","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","5"
"Building Blocks","Bike","This is what we use to grow extend threshold, burn fat and increase cardio capacity. It may seem boring but play some music/ podcast from your ipod or whatever. This stuff is BOSS. What turns you into a cyclist.. Aim for the RPE/ data numbers. But CADENCE is important if you have a cadence counter aim for an average of 90 or above.. If not just spin those legs as fast as you can.. Most importantly in the recovery periods as this is what flushes the toxins out of those legs muscles and helps them to recover so they are ready to smash the pedals again!","1.75","","2022-02-24","These long efforts are the gospel of high performance cycling, this is ensuring your 'base' is nice and strong, this is your foundation for building strength and speed upon.

"Flat Foot strength","Bike","This may seem counter intuitive after the 'Spin to win' fest. But today we are slowing that RPM right down to emphasise the importance of the position of your foot in the pedal action. Note in those 6minute 'working' sectors the cadence range is slowed right down to 50-60. I want you pushing a hard gear and being cognisant of that 'sccoping' motion through the pedal stroke. Imagine you are taking a spoonful of neopolitan and the sole of your shoe is the spoon. During this entire pedal stroke focus on keeping the sole of that foot PARALLEL to the floor during the whole motion. The flatter that foot is the more power goes into those pedals.. Again channel all that energy from the mind, forehead, neck, shoulders... ALL the way down your body and into those pedals. This will activate your strength system which is important especially for hill climbing and sprinting. Note the RPM numbers and keep that foot flat! Another habit we are trying to create with this workout.","1.08333333333333","","2022-03-01","The 6 min 10/10 sections I just want you seated in the drops pushing HARD gear as possible with cadence only 60rpm!","25355.4296875","","",""," *02/03/2022 Matthew Roberts: This type of thing is right up my alley.  No problems grinding a low gear and form seemed OK from the start (as far as I can tell)* *03/03/2022 Justin Morris: Good man, yep gathered you'd like these ones after our chat. These translate into increase in climbing power. So be good to keep a good rhythm of these going, they not the type of effort where you notice quick big gains. More of a gradual development but takes you high in the power output/ endurance. generally a 10-12 week consistent use of these style efforts really lifts a rider.*","1.11972224712372","6.28999996185303","","80","","132","170","","","0.667117176431515","55.36","5","13","21","16","9","2","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","3"
"Home Trainer 1 Leg Session !","Bike","This is designed to SMOOTH out your pedalling motion. It is very, very effective but also quite challenging! Set up a chair or something to prop your non working leg on next to the trainer. The main priority in this is to be SMOOTH! No stress about heart rate or power or anything else. Smooth, like you are buttering toast with peanut butter and the bottom of your foot is the knife. I don't want you to stress about numbers per se. The 9 & 6 RPE on the workout builder are just to indicate when the 1 leg sessions are (9=1 leg, 6+2 legs). NO power, NO HR really required The 1 minute between each 1 leg sector allows a bit of recovery (clip both legs back in for this 1 min). Then that 10min working session toward the end both legs in and I want you to note if you feel any different sensations in your pedal stroke after doing the 1 leggers Another KEY building block for a cyclist, this is FORM and STYLE on the bike - this is what allows you to push more power through the pedals when we dial this in.","1","","2022-03-02","This will give you 4x1 min Left leg and 4x 1min Right leg.

"Lollipop Efforts","Bike","You will need a bag of Chupa Chups for this one! Breathing is the basis of performance in sport and indeed the basis of life. Getting it under control unlocks power/ energy that can contribute to your performance. The default habit when your HR is working is to suck in air via open mouth breathing. To begin to incorporate the passages of the nose will create a new habit that lends itself to increased performance. Breathing in through the nose generally gets a deeper breath than via the mouth also. Complete the warm up as per normal then at the 18-20min mark put the lollipop in the mouth and complete all extra efforts with the chupa chup in the mouth! An old school breath training technique that works! Be patient with it, try to let frustration pass over you during this. You are strong, like porcelain! 100% FOCUS on your effort with most of that focus being on your breath!","1.4","","2022-03-17","Have a spare lollipop or 3 on hand for when the first one runs out.

"Climbing & Descending skills","Bike","You'll need your local climb today and we are going to head UP and DOWN it 3 times with increasing intensity. ON THE CLIMB: Focus on keeping that upper body nice and relaxed and stable. Imagine your spone and the seatpost of your bike are one vertical line.. Aim for symmetry between your upper body and your machine. Relax those shoulders, deep breaths this will set off a wave of composure down your body. Turn it into power when it gets to your legs. Shift your weight slightly back in the saddle and encourage a 'scooping' motion through the pedals. Remember you are getting power into those pedals when pushing down AND when pulling up. Look at that RPE number and remember you want to SUSTAIn that effort for the entire climb. Don't go too deep at the bottom of the 1st climb.. ON THE DESCENT: Descending is an element in cycling where the gains can be easily made but the consequences of getting it wrong are often dire. Getting your mind comfortable and confident with the experience is often the most difficult part. On shallow descents where the gradient is not too steep and not too many corners focus on continuing to turn the legs over even if it may seem there is no power going into the pedals. This sustains the blood pumping through the legs and helps distribute your balance. Braking is important for more technical descents with corners, on the first descent be apprehensive and get to know the feel of the braking as you come INTO the corner. Try to avoid breaking in the corner. Your goal is to hit the corner already at an appropriate speed and avoiding having to hit the brakes as you turn. Similar to driving a car/ motorbike. You'll notice most of the steering on a descent does not come from the handlebars it comes from the distribution of your weight. Get this right and it assures you balance no matter how steep the road or sharp the turn. When turning, be attentive to counter steering. Balance the bike at speed by placing slight pressure on the handlebar on the opposing side to the direction of the corner. ie. For a left hand turn lean the bike left and keep pressure through the right hand onto the bars. This helps balance the machine when it is being lent over. Same with the feet, for right hand turn your left fott should be slammed down to the bottom of the pedal stroke and vice versa. Focus your attention to all these things and after 3 repeats you'll be on your way to making them new cycling habits.","1.73333333333333","","2022-03-26","1st climb: Sub threshold 2nd climb: on threshold 3rd climb: Above threshold Then a 20min working session.","34691.7109375","","",""," *26/03/2022 Matthew Roberts: That was the toughest yet.

I’m still completely wrecked the next day.* *18/04/2022 Matthew Roberts: I've checked the numbers, I was pulling 157bpm in the first hour and a half.  That was ""race pace"" two months ago - the limit of what I could do over 90 mins.  So no surprise I blew up.  I forgot to pack snacks (too long since I did a long ride) and when I hit the servo at Prestons I was ahead of my PR for the M7.  I can't resist the chance at a PR so I didn't stop for food.  Bad idea.  Next available stop is over 30 mins away so I crawl into Eastern Creek to get coke and choccie milk. Just kept me above completely bonking and struggled home.  I turned off the live segments on my wahoo since its always getting me in trouble, but I knew the halfway time for that ride so it didn't help :) The real surprise is that my legs were not telling me I was going too hard in the first half - felt strong until it all evaporated over a 10 minute period.* *18/04/2022 Matthew Roberts: FYI: commuting on wed/thur/fri this week* *18/04/2022 Justin Morris: Thats promising apart from the nutrition approach. Nutrition is number 1 thing to prepare for on any ride further than 45min. ALWAYS pack food, some short acting carb (lollies/ anything high sugar base) and a slower release carb (oats museli bar). Realistically at a firm pace should be topping up carbs every 60min, so that was the big factor in the bonk today. Especially backing up after yesty. But good to know you were holding highest ever pace on way up, that is evidence your form is coming up if you are holding a race pace with your sensations suggesting you are riding easy. Some of these rides, good to put the garmin in the pocket and just pedal gauging nothing but sensations.*","3.18444442749023","6.89099979400635","","86","","147","181","","","0.783767609046275","223.07","4","7","41","49","61","23","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10","9"

Never too late or too good to revisit the fundamentals of a smooth pedal stroke :-).This is designed to SMOOTH out your pedalling motion. It is very, very effective but also quite challenging!

The 9 & 6 RPE on the workout builder are just to indicate when the 1 leg sessions are. NO power, NO HR really required The 1 minute between each 1 leg sector allows a bit of recovery (clip both legs back in for this 1 min) Then that 10min working session toward the end both legs in and I want you to note if you feel any different sensations in your pedal stroke after doing the 1 leggers Another KEY building block for a cyclist, this is FORM and STYLE on the bike - this is what allows you to push more power through the pedals when we dial this in.","0.85","","2022-05-11","This will give you 4x1 min Left leg and 4x 1min Right leg.

Exactly the opposite is a problem too, trying to stay at ""race pace' and some feature pushes you into way into the red 3) once I go 4 seconds at MAX, any reasonable effort keeps me there.  The lactic acid and the struggling for oxygen starts and it just won't stop unless I really drop off the intensity for a while.

From the start, that ride was not fun.  My legs felt so stiff.  Any attempt to put down power put fatigue into my legs.  I was planning to spend the whole day in zone 2 (on the wahoo) but that was too much for my legs.  Kept drifting back into zone 1.  Started to feel a bit better an hour in, but back in the hurt box an hour later.  By sheer force of will I got the zone 2 time above the zone 1 time, but it was like doing efforts to get there!  Then I stopped for coffee and breakfast.  Get back on and everything is different.  Heart rate happily sitting 20bpm higher, legs happy-as.  Cruised through the last 45 mins and easily managed another 20.  Was that all down to the caffiene?  I did have breakfast (weetbix) before I left, and I did have lollies all through the ride.* *17/10/2022 Justin Morris: Looks like 2 things at play here: -layover fatigue from yesterdays effort where the feelings were good. A bigger focus on recovery Saturday arvo may have helped avert this. ie. more food! -Fuelling inadequacy morning of. The weet bix likely did not suffice again mainly due to yesterdays effort. It sounds like a purely situational issue given yesterdays really good session. Missing Those big recovery feeds post ride often cannot be rescued by sugars mid ride the following day. The early morning is generally not conducive to higher intensity anyway, but yeah Z2 should have been achievable. Overall you still got a lot out of this ride.

"Race day - structured warmup","Bike","Begin about 1 hour and no later than 50 minutes before race start. You need 30 minutes for this session. Try not to rush it. Scout out a good warmup location. A quiet, long road, a good hill, or even a nearby suburban block you can go round and round will all be okay. If you can access the race course, it's fine to do it there too. The race-warm-up session prepares the body for the event ahead. The intensity of the first ramp is gradually increased over a 10 minute period. Take it slowly. At about 9 minutes into the first ramp, your heart rate or power output should be at threshold - hold this for the last 60 seconds but don't go over threshold. Next, carry out a short easy recovery spin before two short threshold efforts for 1 minute. Again. Don't do all-out efforts. Threshold will feel easy if the adrenaline is pumping. That's good! If you are running late or strapped for time or if the weather is very hot, skip the last one or two threshold intervals and do a shorter cool down. Time this session so you have enough time to get to the start line without cooling down too much. I always start 1 hour to 50 mins before. Then do a quick dunny break and get to the start line 15 minutes before the gun. Any spare time, just ride close to the start and keep the legs turning over.","0.45","","2022-11-20","","3373.4599609375","","","","","0.391666680574417","2.39299988746643","","78","","133","167","","","0.66925185347156","18.98","2","4","8","6","3","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First lap was at a decent pace but it got worse every lap.  Last lap I was creeping, worried I was going to lose my lunch.  My post-mortem is that a) I was sick leading up, b) I had too much sugar and my stomach said no, c) the course had a big climb which is not my strength. I lost one water bottle at the start and only had my gatorade bottle left.  Made the bad decision not to swap it out at the end of the last lap for my spare bottle and combined with honey on my porridge fro breakfast, gatorade before race, and lollies before race - not good.  So the die is set now for my race nutrition: normal breakfast, a handfull of lollies before race, first bottle is water, second bottle (lap 3+) is isotonic.* *20/11/2022 Justin Morris: Sounds like dehydration was the main culprit here and been sick. The gatorade offers no real hydration (despite what the label might say) so it really needs to be tempered with H2O. If went straight to sports drink off the start you would have been dehydrated by the end of first lap and then the drink you did have was just making it worse. Enjoy the day off tomorrow and hopefully shakes that sickness.

"Race day - structured warmup","Bike","Begin about 1 hour and no later than 50 minutes before race start. You need 30 minutes for this session. Try not to rush it. Scout out a good warmup location. A quiet, long road, a good hill, or even a nearby suburban block you can go round and round will all be okay. If you can access the race course, it's fine to do it there too. The race-warm-up session prepares the body for the event ahead. The intensity of the first ramp is gradually increased over a 10 minute period. Take it slowly. At about 9 minutes into the first ramp, your heart rate or power output should be at threshold - hold this for the last 60 seconds but don't go over threshold. Next, carry out a short easy recovery spin before two short threshold efforts for 1 minute. Again. Don't do all-out efforts. Threshold will feel easy if the adrenaline is pumping. That's good! If you are running late or strapped for time or if the weather is very hot, skip the last one or two threshold intervals and do a shorter cool down. Time this session so you have enough time to get to the start line without cooling down too much. I always start 1 hour to 50 mins before. Then do a quick dunny break and get to the start line 15 minutes before the gun. Any spare time, just ride close to the start and keep the legs turning over.","0.45","","2022-12-18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Zone 2 with singletrack","MTB","There is a large body of evidence demonstrating the positive physiological benefits of Zone 2 riding - which is great because it's easy. Bear in mind though that proper Zone 2 riding takes considerable focus. It's very easy to go out and do a random ride that starts too hard and finishes too easy. Watch ya heart rate for this one and stick to the heart rate zone. Pedal softly uphill and keep the pressure on the pedals down the hills. Ride some singletrack in the second half of the ride. Try to keep a similar feeling of load on your HR, although it will likely drop and rise out of the channel. This is fine. Return to Zone 2 once you're back on the road. Prob use OMV for this would be ideal.","2","","2023-01-08","","57423.6484375","","","","","2.47277784347534","6.45100021362305","","","","118","142","","","0.590777676847534","97.8","33","32","81","2","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That 8-12min effort is the target here, you will get better at appreciating how to pace yourself for this effort. For this distance it is not a full gas start that helps, it is more an 8/10 start and building into the effort.

HARD gear and low cadence, this is building up your strength endurance which will start to filter in through Feb. It is the next level after endurance.. So ability of the muscles to keep dumping out big power for extended periods of time. Low cadence is the key on these, know you don't have the cadence meter, but you know the feeling now. HARD gear just slower revolutions. During those 6min efforts. Alternate hand on the bar and hand behind back. So 1 hand behind back and 1 hand on bar for 30s then swap hands for the whole 6min.
